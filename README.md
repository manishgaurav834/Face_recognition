Introduction to project:

Face identification is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications ranging from security systems to social media tagging. In this
project, we explore various machine learning algorithms for face identification using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Leveraging the
Kaggle API, we access the dataset and preprocess it for feature extraction.
We implement three feature extraction techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Additionally, we integrate Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) with these techniques to enhance discriminative power.
Our project consists of six Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different combinations of feature extraction and dimensionality reduction tech2
Draft
niques. Specifically, we have notebooks for CNN, LBP, and HOG individually, as well as combinations such as CNN with LDA, LBP with LDA,
and HOG with LDA.
To evaluate the performance of our models, we employ a variety of classifiers including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) using both Scikit-learn and TensorFlow Keras, Random Forest,
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive
Bayes. The report is structured to compare the results obtained using different algorithms as well as provide reasons for the obtained results.
Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we compare the accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness of these algorithms. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different machine
learning approaches for face identification tasks.
